# Screens User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
In modern standards, not all the mentioned criteria need to be covered solely by the sign-up feature. Some of the criteria can be addressed during the initial onboarding process or within the app after the user has signed up. Here's a refined list of criteria that should be specifically covered by the sign-up feature, while others can be part of subsequent onboarding steps or user profile settings:

## Sign-Up
1. **Email and Password Sign-Up**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign up using my email and password, so that I can create an account and access the app's features.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The sign-up screen includes fields for entering email and password. User can submit the form to create an account. User receives a confirmation message indicating that an account has been created.

2. **Social Login Options**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign up using my Google, Apple, or Facebook account, so that I can quickly create an account without entering my email and password manually.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The sign-up screen includes buttons for signing up with Google, Apple, and Facebook. User can authenticate using their selected social account. An account is created, and the user is redirected to the app's dashboard upon successful authentication.

3. **Password Validation**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to see validation messages for passwords that do not meet security criteria, so that I can create a secure password.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** If the password is too short or lacks complexity, a validation message is displayed. The validation message specifies the password requirements (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of special characters).

4. **Email Validation**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to see validation messages for invalid email addresses, so that I can correct any mistakes before submitting the form.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** If the email format is incorrect, a validation message is displayed. The validation message specifies the correct format for an email address.

5. **Email Confirmation**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to receive an email verification link after signing up, so that I can verify my email address and activate my account.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Upon successful sign-up, the user receives an email with a verification link. The email includes instructions on how to verify the email address.

6. **Password Confirmation**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to confirm my password by entering it twice, so that I can ensure I did not make any typing errors.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The sign-up screen includes a field for confirming the password. If the passwords do not match, a validation message is displayed.

7. **Terms and Conditions**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to view the terms and conditions and privacy policy before signing up, so that I can understand the app's policies.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** The sign-up screen includes links to the terms and conditions and privacy policy. Users can click the links to view the documents in a new screen or modal.

8. **Duplicate Email Check**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to receive feedback if my email is already registered, so that I can avoid creating duplicate accounts.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** If the entered email is already registered, a message is displayed indicating that the email is in use. The message provides options to log in or reset the password if the user already has an account.

## User Onboarding
1. **Subscription Options**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to choose between a basic (free) and a premium (monthly) subscription during sign-up, so that I can select the plan that best suits my needs.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** This can be part of the onboarding process after the initial sign-up. Users are presented with subscription options and benefits of each plan.

2. **In-App Purchases (IAP)**
   - **User Story:** As a new user selecting the premium (monthly) subscription, I want to complete the payment process using in-app purchases (IAP), so that I can activate my premium features immediately.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** This is typically handled within the app after account creation, where users can complete IAP for premium subscriptions.

3. **Subscription Benefits and Costs**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to understand the benefits of the premium subscription and see the cost clearly displayed, so that I can make an informed decision about upgrading.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Detailed information about subscription plans and costs can be provided during the onboarding process or in the app settings.

4. **Security Information**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to be assured that my payment information is secure, so that I can confidently complete the premium subscription purchase.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Security information can be presented during the payment process within the app.

5. **Subscription Terms and Conditions**
   - **User Story:** As a new user, I want to understand the terms and conditions of the premium subscription, including cancellation policies, so that I know what to expect after subscribing.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** This information can be provided during the onboarding process or in the app settings.

By focusing the sign-up screen on essential account creation steps and deferring additional criteria to the onboarding process or post-sign-up settings, the user experience remains streamlined and user-friendly.
